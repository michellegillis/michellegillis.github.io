  <p>
    Burgeoning data analyst with a B.S in Animal Science from UC Davis. Heavily involved in animal medicine and experimental execution and data collection throughout my undergraduate education. Upon finishing school I sought to gain more technical and data-oriented skills through UC Davisâ€™s data analytics and visualization bootcamp. Strong technical skill sets in Excel, Python, SQL, and R. Excellent work ethic, consistently willing to lead and collaborate with others, strong oral and written communication skills, and highly organized. Strong interest in animal health, wildlife, and preserving natural landscapes. Looking forward to continuing to refine my skills in data analytics and utilize them as problem solving tools in the fields I care about.
